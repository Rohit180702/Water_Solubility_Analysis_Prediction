### Water_Solubility_Analysis_Prediction

Performed a comprehensive analysis on a water quality dataset that contains information on various parameters related to water composition, sources, color, and a target variable indicating water solubility. The goal is to gain insights from the data and ultimately build a prediction model to forecast water solubility based on the provided attributes.
